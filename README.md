# sorting_visualizer
In this project I implemented the quick sorting, merge sorting, selection sorting, and bubble sorting algorithms into a processing sketch to visualize how the different sorting methods work as well as their time complexities. This project helped me simultaneously develop an in-depth understanding of various sorting methods as well as how to visualize the process using the Processing package.


Quick sort:

Bubble sort:

Merge sort:

Selection sort:
